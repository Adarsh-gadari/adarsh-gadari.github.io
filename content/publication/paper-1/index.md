abstract: |
  We present a novel approach for robust retinal layer segmentation using OCT B-scans, leveraging the Pix2Pix Generative Adversarial Network. Our method demonstrates improved accuracy and generalizability across diverse datasets.

summary: Robust retinal layer segmentation using OCT B-scans with Pix2Pix GAN.
