#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hello and welcome! I’m delighted to share my journey, work, and aspirations with you on this personal website. For nearly a decade, I have immersed myself in the world of Artificial Intelligence—working with both structured and unstructured data, across academia and industry. I have always embraced opportunities to learn, grow, and contribute, believing that every challenge is a chance to sharpen my skills and make a difference.

I find myself at the intersection of technology that addresses today’s pressing challenges and science that dares to question and expand the boundaries of human understanding. This dual passion fuels my drive to be both a researcher and a problem-solver, convinced that technological innovation can guide us toward a brighter future.

### Why am I interested in redefining human belief or challenging current knowledge?

Have you seen the series "Genius," where Albert Einstein isolates a light wave to unravel its mysteries, or "A Beautiful Mind," which captures John Nash’s relentless passion? Or perhaps "The Imitation Game," where Alan Turing’s work saves lives, or "Minority Report," which explores futuristic technology and philosophical questions? These stories inspire me to think deeply, pursue knowledge fearlessly, and use science to make a meaningful impact.

### Why am I interested in solving current challenges?

Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam once shared that one of his proudest achievements was providing lightweight prosthetics—originally designed for space technology—to children with disabilities. ([news article](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/kalam-concerned-about-disabled-developed-lightweight-prosthetics-115072801304_1.html)) Stories like this remind me that technology, when applied thoughtfully, can transform lives. I’ve also witnessed firsthand how human error and systemic challenges can affect patient care, especially in developing countries. This motivates me to create robust, precise technological solutions that truly make a difference.

### What are my skills?

Throughout my journey, I have developed expertise in Deep Learning, Generative AI, Medical Image Segmentation, Hypergraph Neural Networks, Explainability, Signal Processing, and Human-Computer Interaction, among others.

### What are my educational qualifications?

I am a recent Master’s graduate in Computer Science (Class of 2025), passionate about applying AI and machine learning to solve meaningful problems—particularly in healthcare and medical imaging. I hold a Master’s degree in Communication and Signal Processing (Electrical Engineering) from the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad (Class of 2018).

### What is the purpose of this website?

**For collaborators:** I am always open to new ideas and partnerships. I believe the most impactful research happens when we come together as a community to tackle complex problems.

**For employers:** I welcome the opportunity to work together. I can be helpful in solving computer vision problems using AI/ML and driving businesses through innovative and impacful research and engineering outcomes. 

**For everyone else:** Please feel free to reach out with questions or just to connect. I look forward to meaningful conversations and new connections.
